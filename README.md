# New-Super-Mario-Bros-Save-Editor
A save editor for New Super Mario Bros. for the DS. To get your .SAV savefile, you can choose 'Export Backup Memory' in DeSmuME, use TWLTool on your 3DS with homebrew, or however else you wish/know how to retrieve a .SAV save from NSMBDS.

Hey ! RedStoneMatt here !

So this is a fork of newluigidev's NSMB Save Editor. I originally wanted to make mine, but since one has already be made, I decided to clean it up (as the original code is 3 years old and a bit messy) and to upgrade it !

All credits of course goes to newluigidev for the original version, RoadRunnerWMC for the checksum reverse-engineering (and other help) and to shibboleet for documenting the save file structure.

I know this upgrade will probably not be useful for many, but who cares, I'm doing it for fun :p
